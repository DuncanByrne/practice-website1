# practice-website1

I've made this practise website just to practice html, css and pushing to github. I do not plan on updating these websites they're just for practice and fun.

If you take interest in visiting this website it is just about Golden Retrievers, with some links to videos and basic pictures of Golden retrievers.

I am very new to coding and programming so i just want to practice the basics as much as possible.
